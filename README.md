Hello, it's basically V-Hud but re-written and improved in every single aspect, the preview should show everything you need to know, and if anyone is interested,  i could add optional support for a couple of frameworks.

**[Script Information]**
1. Performance: Runs at 0.00 Resmon (Client).
2. Completely standalone meaning no other dependencies required.
3. If you would like to contribute, please go ahead and head over to the GitHub page and feel free to send a pull request.
